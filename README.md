# HOME-AUTOMATION-WITH-BLUETOOTH

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
**NAME**: OMKAR GURAV
**INTERN ID**: CT04DG2476
**DOMAIN**: Embedded Systems
**DURATION**: 4 WEEKS
**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Bluetooth-controlled home automation system using **Arduino Uno** and the **HC-06 Bluetooth module**. It was developed during a 4-week internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS to showcase wireless control over electronic appliances using a mobile app.

The Android application sends commands to Arduino via Bluetooth. Based on the received command, LEDs (representing home devices) are turned ON or OFF. This setup mimics smart control used in modern home automation systems.

## Objectives

* Create a mobile-controlled LED system using Bluetooth.
* Learn serial communication (UART) with HC-06.
* Simulate the setup in Proteus and test the working.
* Design a user-friendly Android app interface using MIT App Inventor.

##  Tools & Components

* **IDE**: Arduino IDE
* **Simulation**: Proteus Design Suite
* **Mobile App**: MIT App Inventor
* **Language**: Embedded C
* **Hardware**:

  * Arduino Uno
  * HC-06 Bluetooth Module
  * 2 LEDs
  * Resistors
  * Android Smartphone

##   How It Works

1. Load code into Arduino using Arduino IDE.
2. Connect HC-06 to Arduino (TX/RX pins).
3. Pair HC-06 with the Android app.
4. Use buttons to turn LED1/LED2 ON or OFF.
5. Commands are sent via Bluetooth and received by Arduino.
6. Arduino interprets them and controls LEDs accordingly.
